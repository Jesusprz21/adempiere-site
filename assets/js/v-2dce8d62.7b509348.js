The author or someone else integrates the branch. Author and committer are the same.</li><li>Transplant from an external HG repo (e.g., iDempiere). Initial author&#39;s name is preserved, and the changes are integrated with the integrator&#39;s name.</li><li>Contribution is a zip file in the tracker. The integrator opens a branch, applies the patch, commits with their name, and integrates with their name.</li></ol></li><li>It was agreed upon that the author is responsible for placing their code in the header of their authorship, and it must be documented with a tracker.</li><li>Release log will include the last committer/author from the code/tracker.</li></ul><h3 id="_2-service-pack-release" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_2-service-pack-release" aria-hidden="true">#</a> 2.
