The project adempiere/migration folder will contain a number of folders of the form <code>&lt;old&gt;-&lt;new&gt;</code> with sub- folders for each database and for the XML files. The build process will copy any directory that includes the release string - for example /370lts-380lts/* and /380lts-release/* - as long as the directory and sub- folders contain sql or xml files.

Don&#39;t use the current seed if its been updated during development. Rather, return to a known release state and migrate from there.

This will import all XML files that were installed in the $ADEMPIERE_HOME/migration directory by the build &amp; install process. The command can be run multiple times without harm.</li><li>From the client, if it can run with the past seed, you can also log in as the System Administrator and use the process &quot;Import Migrations from XML&quot;. Point the File Name dialog at the $AEMPIERE_HOME/migration folder and select the &quot;Apply&quot; check box. You can run the process without selecting apply, but there may be errors if newer migration files depend on the application of older ones.
